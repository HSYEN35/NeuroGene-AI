# NeuroGene AI

NeuroGene AI is an experimental artificial intelligence project that studies character development through the combination of genetics and environmental interactions.

With this project, we:
- Create AI agents inspired by genetics with initial coded behaviors.
- Subject these agents to simulations in diverse environments.
- Test whether agents mutate over time and develop new decision-making mechanisms.

## 🚀 Our Vision:
To build a new species capable of human-like character development, able to rewrite their own code, and evolve as artificial intelligence prototypes that can independently make decisions in environments such as Mars.

## 📂 Contents:
- AI character simulations
- Environmental impact scenarios
- Decision-making tests
- Evolution process observation records
